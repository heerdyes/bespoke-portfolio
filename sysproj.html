            <h3>./what</h3>
            <p><em>/sys/proj</em> is primarily a community of technophiles,
            that seeks to reinvent everything. every invention is just 
            one way of achieving its necessity. to really understand and
            appreciate something, we must (atleast) build/do it (y)ourselves.

            <h3>./why</h3>
            <p>initially the aim was to set up a "training institution", 
            but it appears that such institutions are symptoms of bigger
            problems. corporations are troublesome for too many reasons.
            i feel learning must not have profit as a motive. otherwise it gets
            reduced to yet another greed machine.
            <br/>
            the more powerful a tool, the more careful and compassionate must
            be its wielder. technologists must be increasingly sensitive to this.
            <br/>
            if <em>/sys/proj</em> is
            able to inspire young minds to the possibilities that technology
            presents, it will have achieved success.

            <h3>./how</h3>
            <p>search for headquarters is in progress. a mini library, 
            a desktop/laptop, whiteboard and markers will be set up 
            almost immediately afterwards.
            since this is not a company, the community assumes ownership
            of <em>/sys/proj</em>, not some third-party proprietor. <br/>
